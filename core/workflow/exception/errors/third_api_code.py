"""
Third-party API error code definitions.

This module defines error codes returned by various third-party services
that are integrated with the workflow system. These codes represent the
raw error responses from external APIs before they are converted to
internal system error codes for consistent handling.

The error codes in this module are the original error codes returned by
external services and are used as input to the CodeConvert utility for
mapping to internal system error codes. This separation ensures that
external service changes don't directly impact the internal error handling
system.

Supported third-party services:
- Spark AI models and engines (comprehensive error coverage)
- Image generation services (format, schema, and audit errors)
- SparkLink tool services (initialization, protocol, and execution errors)
- Code execution environments (pod readiness and execution failures)
- Content audit services (compliance and violation detection)

Error Code Ranges by Service:
- Code execution: 1, 10405 (pod and execution errors)
- Image generation: 10003-10022 (format, schema, capacity, audit errors)
- SparkLink tools: 30001-30600 (initialization, protocol, execution errors)
- Spark models: 10000-11203 (WebSocket, auth, rate limiting, engine errors)
- Audit services: 999999 (internal audit service errors)

These codes are systematically organized to facilitate error mapping and
provide clear categorization for different types of external service failures.

class ThirdApiCodeEnum(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of third-party API error codes.

    Each error code is defined as a tuple containing:
    - code: Integer error code from third-party service
    - msg: Human-readable error message from the external service

    Error codes are organized by service type with specific ranges:
    - Code execution errors (10405, 1): Pod readiness and execution failures
    - Image generation errors (10003-10022): AI image generation service errors
    - SparkLink tool errors (30001-30600): External tool integration errors
    - Spark model errors (10000-11203): AI model service errors including WebSocket,
                                        auth, and rate limiting
    - Audit errors (999999): Content audit service internal errors

    These codes are used as input to the CodeConvert utility for mapping
    to internal system error codes.
